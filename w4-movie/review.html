    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>

    <div class="info">
      <p>This movie was a blast from start to finish! The humor was goofy in the best way, and the characters were full of personality. I especially liked the pirate captain. He is funny without even trying.</p>

    <h2>Unexpected Moments</h2>
 
    <div class="info">
     <p>I was really surprised when I found out that Queen Victoria was such a tough fighter. I never thought sheâ€™d be like that.She was intense!<p>
     <p>And then there was this funny moment when they ended up in a science fair by mistake instead of a treasure cave. It was so random and made me laugh. </p>
